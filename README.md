# What's the best wildlife (ðŸ¦œ) camera?

I'm interested in wildlife photography (especially birds), but I'm intimidated by the range of expensive equipment. There are plenty of suggestions for the optimal "setup", but I don't trust opinions, I trust data. Thankfully, Cornell's [Macaulay library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) of wildlife photography has lots of it, including stunning photographs with detailed information about the cameras and lenses that took them. I used this data to determine the "setups" responsible for some of the most stunning bird photography done by professionals and amateurs alike.
