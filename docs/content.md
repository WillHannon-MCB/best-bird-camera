# What's the best wildlife (especially birds) camera?

I'm interested in wildlife photography (especially of birds), but I'm intimidated by all the expensive equipment on offer. Of course, there are plenty of blogs and vlogs suggesting the optimal "setup", but I don't trust people's opinions.

I trust data, and thankfully, Cornell's [Macaulay library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) of wildlife photography has lots of it, including stunning photographs with detailed information about the cameras and lenses that took them. I thought about manually clicking through my favorites and making a mental note of the photographer's preferred equipment. But that would still be subjective. Instead, I decided to do little programming and scale this approach into something useful.
